This file contains a modified version of HOTS_Sparse_Net class 
with some differencies to work with channeled data, as building time surfaces,
with reference timestamps only from a referenced channel, 
and looking at past events rather than upcoming ones 
 
The original repo can be found on :

# Class for HOTS_Sparse_Net

# learning, reconstruction and classification of the input data

class HOTS_Sparse_Net:
    # Network constructor settings, the net is set in a random state,
    # with random basis and activations to define a starting point for the 
    # optimization algorithms
    # Treating ON and OFF events separately for each level generate 2 sublayers for 
    # each sublayer in the previous stage. In the first layer we have a single sublayer
    # (the layer itself), and since that the negative activations needs to be treated 
    # independently, in the next layer we have to train 2 sublayers that will deal
    # with both polarity, that will respectivelty generate 2 polarity events each.
    # This critical structure carries the result that for a layer i, the number \
    # of sublayers of this layer will be 2**i 
    # =============================================================================
    # basis_number: it is a list containing the number of basis used for each layer
    # basis_dimension: it is a list containing the linear dimension of the base set
    #                for each layer (they are expected to be squared)
    # taus: it is a list containing the time coefficient used for the time surface creations
    #       for each layer, all three lists need to share the same lenght obv.
    # first_layer_polarities : The number of polarities that the first layer will
    #                          have to handle, for ATIS cameras, it is usually,

    # Method for online learning, essentially it performs a single step of gradient
    # descent for each time surface, with a settable learning_rate. 
    # The method is full online but it espects to work on an entire dataset
    # at once to be more similiar in structure to its offline counterpart.
    # This library has the porpouse to test various sparse HOTS implementations
    # and to compare them, not to work in real time! (If it's worthy a real time
    # will hit the shelfs soon)
    # =============================================================================
    # dataset: the initial dataset used for learning
    # channel: the idea behind multi channel rapresentation is to build surfaces
    #          synchronizing only with lower frequency activities.
    # method : string with the method you want to use :
    #          "CG" for Coniugate Gradient Descent
    #          "Exp distance" for the model with lateral inhibition and explicit
    #           exponential distance computing
    # base_norm : Select whether use L2 norm or threshold constraints on basis
    #             learning with the keywords "L2" "Thresh" 
    # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # The following series of parameters can evolve during learning, thus 
    # they are expected to be defined as lists with [begin_value, end_value, time_coeff]
    # Where begin_value is the value used for learning the first time surface,
    # end_value is the value at steady state and time_coeff defines how quickly,
    # the monotonic function describing the evolution of the parameter reaches it
    #
    # noise_ratio: The model responses can be mixed with noise, it can improve  
    #               learning speed 
    # sparsity_coeff: The model presents lateral inhibtion between the basis,
    #                 it selects a winner depending on the responses, and feed 
    #                 back it's activity timed minus the sparsity_coeff to 
    #                 inhibit the neighbours. a value near one will result
    #                 in a Winner-Takes-All mechanism like on the original 
    #                 HOTS (For CG it's implemented as a weighted L1 coinstraint
    #                 on the activations in the Error function)
    # sensitivity : Each activation is computed as a guassian distance between 
    #               a base and the upcoming timesurface, this coefficient it's
    #               the gaussian 'variance' and it modulates cell selectivity
    #               to their encoded feature (Feature present only on Exp distance)
    # learning_rate : It's the learning rate, what do you expect me to say ?

    # Like in the original work, first it computes the sparse response a_j, but then
    # it performs cognugate gradient descent on the all batch of images at the same time
    # to find the optimal basis. This process is then iterated until it reaches the 
    # expected precision or the max number of steps
    # Advice : It is slow as 2001: A Space Odyssey, but can be considered a good 
    # groundtruth for comparisons
    # NB: If you have a background of machine learning, please note that here 
    # the term batch is used to define a single record of events (like multiple
    # events recorded from the same letter in a multiple letter dataset)
    # Therefore this offline algorithm is performing optimization through different
    # batches at the same time. I'm sorry if you are confused by the therminolgy, 
    # looking at the code will simplify things...... ahahah just kidding it's a mess
