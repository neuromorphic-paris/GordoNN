# GordoNN
GordoNN is a model for speech recognition for neuromorphic cochleas based on two implementations of HOTS,
the first being the zero dimentional HOTS from Germain, Kevin and Ryad, and the second a new online compressive HOTS
The repository at the moment contains a single benchmark of classification of two commans ("On","Off"), and all the function and 
classes implementig the model in Libs. Due to memory limitation the Datasets are not loaded on the repo.

(One of the biggest problems to deal with cochleas is to account for the different gain values of each filter)
